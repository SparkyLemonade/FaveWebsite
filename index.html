    <p> I love reading books! All types of books are fun to read and it really helps me when I'm bored. Books can grow your knowledge and brain, and they have an added bonus of not being on a electronic device. I especially love fantasy and mystery books. It's really nice to read a book in a comfy place on a rainy day. This is my hobby. </p>
